// This is a simple slider project working with the NASA daily image API 
// I'm using a slider method 
// I'm reading the metadata 'description' from each image to display on a floating div as each image shuffles
// I picked a pixelated spacy font to appeal to the style of spaceiness
// I want the images to take almost full screen and presence so I decided to use a slightly translucent field to display the information
